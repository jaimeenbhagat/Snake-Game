## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat the red food, growing in length with each piece of food consumed. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or with itself.

## Features

- Classic snake movement and growth mechanics
- Food randomly appears on the screen
- Score and high score tracking
- Game over and reset functionality
- Smooth movement and increasing difficulty

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd snake-game
    ```

4. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

## How to Play

- Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right respectively.
- The snake will continue moving in the current direction until a new direction is specified.
- The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
- Try to eat as much food as possible to achieve a high score!

## Gameplay

- The snake starts with a length of one.
- Each piece of food increases the snake's length by one segment.
- The game speed increases slightly with each piece of food consumed.
- The current score and the highest score are displayed at the top of the screen.
